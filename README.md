# Data Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of data engineering projects. This collection showcases my ability to solve real-world data problems, focusing on data pipelines, ETL processes, and analytics. Each project demonstrates how I approach data challenges, from identifying issues and making assumptions to developing solutions and refining them through trial and error.

## Projects
### 1. [Data Engineering Solutions](./Phase_1/README.md)
- **Project Stage**: Data Collection, Data Modeling, Data Querying, and Initial Visualization
- **Objective**: Built an data pipeline to be later used in analytics, transforming raw data into actionable insights.
- **Skills**: Designing Relational Database, data structure, Data Cleaning, Data Visuzlization
- **Results**: Reduced processing time by XX%, providing real-time Business Intelligence analytics.

### 2. [Automation and Improvement](./Phase_2/README.md)
- **Project Stage**: Automations, Tools and Technologies, Implementation Plan, and Expected Outcomes

*(More projects coming soon)*

## Technologies & Tools
- **Languages**: Python, SQL, Bash
