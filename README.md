# Data Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of data engineering projects. This collection showcases my ability to solve real-world data problems, focusing on data pipelines, ETL processes, and analytics. Each project demonstrates how I approach data challenges, from identifying issues and making assumptions to developing solutions and refining them through trial and error.

## Projects
### 1. [Capstone Project](./Phase_1/README.md)
- **Project Stage**: Data Engineering solution to Build Data Platform for Retailer Data Analytics
- **Objective**:
1. design the OLTP database for an E-Commerce website, populate the OLTP Database with the provided data, and automate the export of the daily incremental data into the data warehouse.
2. set up a NoSQL database to store the catalog data for an E-Commerce website, load the E-Commerce catalog data into the NoSQL database, and query the E-Commerce catalog data in the NoSQL database.
3. design the schema for a data warehouse based on the schema of the OLTP and NoSQL databases, and load the data into fact and dimension tables, automate the daily incremental data insertion into the data warehouse.
4. create a Cognos data source that points to a data warehouse table.
5. extract data from OLTP, NoSQL, and MongoDB databases into CSV format; and then transform the OLTP data to suit the data warehouse schema, and then load the transformed data into the data warehouse.
6. create a Spark connection to the data warehouse, and then deploy a machine learning model on SparkML for making projections.
- **Skills**: Data Engineering
- **Results**: empowering organizations and businesses to make data-driven decision to drive profitability.
