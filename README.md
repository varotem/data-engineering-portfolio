# Data Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of data engineering projects. This collection showcases my ability to solve real-world data problems, focusing on data pipelines, ETL processes, and analytics. Each project demonstrates how I approach data challenges, from identifying issues and making assumptions to developing solutions and refining them through trial and error.

## Projects
### 1. [User Analytics Pipeline](./Project_1/README.md)
- **Objective**: Built an ETL pipeline for user analytics, transforming raw data into actionable insights.
- **Skills**: Python, SQL, Apache Airflow, Data Cleaning, ETL Processes.
- **Results**: Reduced processing time by 30%, providing real-time user behavior analytics.

### 2. [Sales Data Analysis](./Project_2/README.md)
- **Objective**: Analyzed sales data to forecast demand and optimize inventory.
- **Skills**: SQL, Pandas, Data Visualization, Financial Forecasting.
- **Results**: Improved sales forecasting accuracy by 15%.

*(More projects coming soon)*

## Technologies & Tools
- **Languages**: Python, SQL, Bash
- **Data Tools**: Apache Airflow, Pandas, PostgreSQL
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Power BI, Tableau
- **Version Control**: Git
