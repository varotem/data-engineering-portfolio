# Data Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of data engineering projects. This collection showcases my ability to solve real-world data problems, focusing on data pipelines, ETL processes, and analytics. Each project demonstrates how I approach data challenges, from identifying issues and making assumptions to developing solutions and refining them through trial and error.
